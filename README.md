## the fundamentals of a **good** developer

![Good Dev!](https://miro.medium.com/max/656/1*DqZgnVy9X9iZChS-1whK1g.png "to be good dev")



1. The design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
2.  one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.
3. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. — Leonardo da Vinci

4. Complexity : Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
5. Maintenance : There will always be some implementation of changes. Not only you have to implement them, but you also have to maintain them over time. As a developer, thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.
6. Consistency Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.
7. ***Good enough*** is fine Don't chas perfection.
8. Predictions  Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.


## Good Dev   VS    Bad Dev

| Title            | Good Dev | Bad Dev                                         |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| complexity       | is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers  | is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity |
| Maintenance      | focus on the problem they will solve and how their software will help people.    |      usually ignore how important it is                                           |
| Self-Development |  Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools    |                      obsessive about one technology                           |
